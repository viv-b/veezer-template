  The Veezer template uses liquid templating within the <a
  href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy SSG
  (Static Site Generator).</a> It's configured to be edited in the <a
  href="https://cloudcannon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudCannon</a>
  environment.


  ## Basic requirements


  A few ideas I set out with when developing Veezer:


  #### Keep editing simple.


  Simplify and automate editing enough so that editors can work just with
  content and not be too concerned with layout.


  #### Provide a way to keep a consistent theme.


  Keep consistency between pages using a configurarable theme. The theme is
  based on a series of light and dark background and text colours (selected via
  a dropdown within components).


  #### Use a partial page refresh.


  Using the Fetch API, load the content for the new page into the `<main>`
  element of the primary layout template. The main navigation bar and footer
  remain unaffected.


  #### Make use of animation.


  Make use of animations like fade-ins and position transitions for a smoother
  experience. Ensure animations are triggered only when images have been fully
  loaded by the browser. The <a href="https://gsap.com/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">GSAP Animation Library</a> works really well.


  #### Keep JavaScript maintainable.


  Where practical, for things like image sliders / carousels, I've used my own
  plain vanilla JavaScript rather than third-party tools. It keeps things
  simpler to maintain and adjust for new sites or updates.


  I've used <a href="https://fslightbox.com/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Fullscreen Lightbox</a> in the galleries.


  #### Keep the page loading speed respectable.


  Without making it the primary goal, try to keep the page load times in check.
