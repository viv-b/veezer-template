    title: Layout and image options
    description: >-
      The image has the option of being cropped in several default sizes:


      * original

      * square

      * wide

      * tall


      Images can be placed on the left or right can be padded away from or
      expanded out to the component edge. Overall top and bottom padding (like
      almost all of the components) can be adjusted.


      There's also an option to add parallax to the image within this component
      (so can mix non-parallax and parallax components on each page). Apart from
      the top few images, images lower down the page are natively lazy-loaded.

    title: The call of the untouched grove
    description: >-
      The forest had stood unbroken for centuries, its trees growing so close
      together that sunlight filtered through in drifting shards of gold. It was
      here that the first builders arrived—not conquerors, but listeners. They
      felt the land’s quiet invitation, a subtle permission carried on birdsong
      and the slow creak of branches. Rather than clear the woods, they chose to
      settle *within* it, letting the forest decide where life might gently take
      root.


      They camped beneath the stars for many nights, mapping nothing, measuring
      nothing, learning the moods of moss and soil. Only when the forest grew
      familiar did the idea of cabins emerge—not as structures imposed upon the
      land, but as shelters shaped by it.

    title: Cabins that grew, not rose
    description: >-
      The first cabins were small and humble, built from fallen timber and stone
      uncovered by rain-swollen streams. Walls curved slightly to mirror tree
      trunks; roofs sloped to guide falling leaves and snow. No two cabins were
      alike, for each was guided by the space it occupied, bending around roots
      or nestling into natural clearings.


      As more cabins appeared, they formed a quiet constellation—lantern lights
      flickering through branches like grounded stars. Paths were worn by
      footsteps alone, never cut, and the forest slowly learned the rhythm of
      its new companions.

    title: Living with the forest
    description: >-
      Over time, the builders became caretakers. Cabins were repaired with resin
      and bark, expanded only when the trees themselves shifted to allow it.
      Windows were placed where dawn naturally spilled in; doors opened toward
      streams that sang through the night. The forest responded in kind—storms
      softened near the settlement, and wildlife passed through without fear.


      Children born among the cabins learned early that every structure had a
      story: which tree had offered its wood, which wind had shaped its beams,
      which season had decided its final form.

    title: The woodland haven
    description: >-
      Generations later, travelers spoke of a hidden woodland haven where cabins
      glowed warmly beneath towering canopies, where smoke rose gently and never
      choked the sky. Those who stayed said the cabins felt alive, as if they
      remembered every hand that built them and every soul they sheltered.


      And though the forest remained vast and mysterious, it was no longer
      untouched. It was *understood*—shared with care, patience, and
      respect—each cabin a promise that even in the deepest woods, harmony could
      be built one quiet beam at a time.

    title: The forest that spoke in silence
    description: >-
      The Deepwood was not wild—it was watchful. Long before the first cabin was
      imagined, the trees leaned inward as if conferring, their leaves brushing
      together in thoughtful murmur. Those who entered felt observed, weighed
      not by judgment but by intention. Only a few ever sensed the invitation to
      stay.


      ### Timber whisperers of the deepwood


      The builders arrived one by one, drawn by dreams they could not explain.
      Each dream ended the same way: a fire burning gently between trees that
      did not burn.

    title: Homes carved from permission
    description: >-
      No axe struck living wood. Instead, the forest offered what it
      shed—storm-fallen trunks, split branches, stones loosened by frost. Cabins
      were raised slowly, each beam set only after nights of listening. If a
      structure displeased the land, it would not stand; walls warped, doors
      refused to open, roofs sagged until rebuilt in harmony.


      Over time, the builders learned to read the forest’s subtle approval,
      shaping cabins that felt less built than *revealed*.

    title: A settlement that endured
    description: >-
      Seasons passed, and the cabins endured where others would have failed.
      Snow gathered lightly, storms broke around them, and paths appeared where
      footsteps repeated with care. Travelers later claimed the cabins whispered
      at night—not words, but reassurance.


      Those who stayed understood the truth: the forest was not sheltering the
      cabins. The cabins were sheltering the forest’s memory.


      ### Where light learned to rest


      Mossvale lay in a hollow where fog lingered long after dawn. The forest
      there dimmed sound, softened edges, and turned even fire into a gentle
      thing. When the first lantern was lit, its glow did not push the dark
      away—it settled into it, like a star choosing to land.
