    FAQ:
      - title: >-
          What is magic truly made of, and why does it behave differently across
          the realms?
        main_column: >-
          Magic is formed from an invisible energy known by scholars as the
          Aetherflow, a force shaped by geography, history, and collective
          memory. Forests steeped in age encourage slow, organic magic, while
          volcanic regions produce volatile and aggressive effects. Magic adapts
          to its surroundings much like living creatures do.


          Because each realm formed under unique natural conditions, magic obeys
          different patterns in different lands. Spells developed in one region
          may weaken or transform elsewhere, making study of local ley currents
          essential for any serious practitioner.

      - title: Why do dragons hoard treasure instead of ruling openly?
        main_column: >-
          Dragons hoard objects as anchors to time. Each artifact, coin, or
          weapon carries stories, scents, and echoes of past eras, helping
          long-lived beings remain grounded in a world that changes too quickly
          for them. Treasure functions as memory rather than wealth.


          Ruling directly would entangle dragons in politics, decay, and
          succession. By remaining distant, they preserve autonomy and influence
          events indirectly, choosing when to intervene rather than becoming
          trapped by governance.
      - title: Why do ancient ruins possess greater power than modern structures?
        main_column: >-
          Ancient builders worked slowly and deliberately, aligning their
          structures with natural energy paths and environmental rhythms. Their
          constructions absorbed and stored ambient magic over centuries,
          allowing ruins to become reservoirs of latent power.


          Modern structures prioritize efficiency and speed, rarely lasting long
          enough to accumulate such energy. Power, in this sense, is not
          built—it is earned through time, stability, and continuity.
      - title: Can anyone become a hero, or is greatness predetermined?
        main_column: >-
          Heroism emerges from circumstance rather than birthright. While some
          individuals are born into advantageous positions, decisive moments
          often elevate unlikely figures. Courage, adaptability, and endurance
          shape heroes more reliably than lineage.


          History shows that many celebrated figures began as ordinary people
          who acted when others hesitated. Greatness follows action, not
          prediction.
      - title: Why are enchanted items dangerous when used too often?
        main_column: >-
          Enchanted objects retain traces of intent from their creation. With
          repeated use, these lingering patterns begin influencing their bearer,
          reinforcing certain behaviors or impulses. A tool made for battle, for
          instance, may gradually sharpen aggression.


          This influence is subtle but cumulative. Long-term exposure can blur
          the line between user and artifact, which is why experienced orders
          limit how long any individual may wield powerful items.
      - title: What happens to consciousness after death in the realms?
        main_column: >-
          When life ends, residual energy disperses into the environment,
          leaving impressions rather than identities. In places saturated with
          emotion or magic, these impressions may linger as echoes—fragments of
          memory or instinct rather than thinking beings.


          Such phenomena are often mistaken for spirits, but scholars agree they
          are more akin to recordings left in the fabric of reality. Over time,
          these echoes fade as the energy rebalances.
      - title: Are monsters inherently dangerous, or shaped by their environments?
        main_column: >-
          Most creatures labeled as monsters are products of hostile
          environments, unstable magic, or forced adaptation. Their behavior
          reflects survival strategies rather than malice. In safer conditions,
          many exhibit intelligence or even cooperation.


          Only a small number of entities are fundamentally destructive,
          typically originating from areas where natural laws have broken down.
          These cases are exceptions, not the norm.

      - title: Choosing
        main_column: >-
          ### Choosing the Right Clearing


          ![](/uploads/content/clay-banks-kiomj6l7eao-unsplash.jpg)


          The first decision is where the cabin will stand, and it should be
          discovered rather than forced. Look for a natural clearing with good
          drainage, slight elevation, and protection from prevailing winds.
          Avoid low ground where moisture gathers and ridges where wind scours
          the structure. Spend time observing how sunlight moves, where frost
          lingers, and which paths animals regularly use.


          Test the soil before committing. Dig small holes and watch how they
          respond to rain—standing water is a warning. Ground that feels settled
          and dry will support a cabin for decades, while unstable soil will
          shift and crack foundations. The forest makes its preferences clear to
          those who take the time to listen.
      - title: Materials
        main_column: >-
          ### Materials, Shape, and Longevity


          ![](/uploads/content/hans-m-q4gmk6x-z7o-unsplash.jpg)


          Use timber sourced from nearby trees whenever possible, favoring
          fallen or naturally aged wood. Local materials adjust better to the
          climate and last longer when allowed to dry before use. Cabins endure
          best when built low and broad, with steep roofs to shed rain and deep
          eaves to protect walls from moisture.


          Keep the structure simple and purposeful. Stone footings lift the
          cabin just enough to prevent rot, while multi-use beams and posts
          strengthen the frame without unnecessary complexity. A cabin that
          flexes slightly with seasonal change will survive far longer than one
          built rigid and overworked.
      - title: Living
        main_column: >-
          ### Living With the Forest, Not Against It


          <img src="/uploads/content/clay-banks-6lskem6fkt4-unsplash.jpg"
          height="799" width="1200" />


          A good cabin blends into its surroundings rather than clearing them
          away. Leave trees and undergrowth where possible to block wind and
          prevent erosion, especially on the colder sides of the structure. The
          forest itself provides insulation, shade, and protection when
          respected.


          Plan for smoke, scent, and movement. Position the hearth so smoke
          disperses into open canopy, store food securely above ground, and
          place work areas close to reduce daily disturbance. Over time, moss,
          darkened wood, and worn paths signal harmony—not decay—marking a cabin
          that has settled into the woods rather than fought them.
